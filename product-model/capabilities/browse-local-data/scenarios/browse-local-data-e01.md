# Older bridge or allowance/list failure

## Trigger

A CRM member invokes browse local data for the case “Older bridge or allowance/list failure”.

## Outcome

An older or unavailable native bridge cannot supply newer diagnostics, backup or update fields. Allowance or backup-list failure is shown separately from a successful empty result; no absent bridge response is represented as a verified zero balance or empty disk.
