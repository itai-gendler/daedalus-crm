# Latest abandoned/retried request controls refund

## Trigger

The model client invokes complete model for the case “Latest abandoned/retried request controls refund”.

## Outcome

For a keyed latest request abandoned before streaming response headers, the upstream body is cancelled, a qualifying refund is attempted and the result is 499. For abandonment after nonstreaming JSON arrives, the refund check runs but JSON processing can still complete. An older concurrent keyed sequence cannot refund the latest charge; the receipt gate prevents double refund. Missing keys and later stream-body failures do not gain a blanket cancellation refund guarantee.
