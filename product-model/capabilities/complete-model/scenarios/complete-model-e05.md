# Missing question identifier uses derived identity or per-request charging

## Trigger

The model client invokes complete model for the case “Missing question identifier uses derived identity or per-request charging”.

## Outcome

An absent or invalid explicit question identifier derives one from this account, the first two messages and the fifteen-minute bucket when available. Matching live receipts can reuse a charge; otherwise an ordinary fresh charge occurs. When derivation is unavailable, accounting falls back to per-request charging. Failed receipt lookup also falls back to a per-request debit.
