# Qualifying provider failures refund

## Trigger

The model client invokes complete model for the case “Qualifying provider failures refund”.

## Outcome

Network failure or timeout returns 504. Upstream 5xx, 429, 408, 401, 402, 403 and 404 qualify for refund; upstream credential/access failures become a sanitized 503 and 429 has its retry message. With a question key, only the latest sequence and an unrefunded receipt can refund once. Refund bookkeeping failure can retain the debit.
