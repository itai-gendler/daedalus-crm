# Cancel/queue handling

## Trigger

A CRM member invokes ask ai for the case “Cancel/queue handling”.

## Outcome

A second submitted question queues behind the active answer rather than starting concurrently. It starts when that answer finishes, fails or is interrupted. Canceling the active stream displays its interrupted result; a started provider request need not stop merely because the view closes.
