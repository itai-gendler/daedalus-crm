# Overlapping version conflict or missing dependency

## Trigger

A CRM member invokes edit customer for the case “Overlapping version conflict or missing dependency”.

## Outcome

Only nonoverlapping edits merge. Conflicting fields produce a conflict rather than overwriting another change; missing referenced records refuse that dependency.
