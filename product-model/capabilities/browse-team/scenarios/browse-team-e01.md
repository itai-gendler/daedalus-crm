# Offline/removed/not activated

## Trigger

A CRM member invokes browse team for the case “Offline/removed/not activated”.

## Outcome

Offline access retains available local team/sync state while reporting the unavailable service. Removed membership and a not-yet-activated team prevent a successful push/pull result; local data is not represented as remotely synchronized.
